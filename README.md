# Overview
I wrote a Calculator and Temperature Converter. The Calculator is primarily for simple operations. It is capable of doing operations up to 5 numbers but isn't capable of doing two different operations in one equation.

I wanted to make a simple software that could perform more than function. So a calculator and temp converter while having the same basis serve two different purposes.

# Development Environment


I used the Intellij IDEA to create my project and code.
I used kotlin for my program and created an object class to store values for the equations.
# Useful Websites

* W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/index.php)

# Future Work


* Item 1 I want to make it so I can use more than one operator in an equation
* Item 2 I would like add a kelvin temp converter as well
